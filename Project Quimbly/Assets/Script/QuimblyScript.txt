Hey there Mark, welcome to [Project Quimbly] (The name isn't in place yet)
null
As you may be wondering. What's even going on right now?
null
well lucky for you I have created this short tutorial.
null
See on the right over there? That little thing that says 20/20 with a lightning bolt icon?
null
that right there is your energy, talking to girls and working reduces it.
null
on the other hand you have money!
null
Money makes the world go round honey!
null
You can use that to buy gifts and pay rent for your luxorious apartment!
null
Later on in the game you can use the grocery store to buy groceries to learn food recipies (For all you feeders out there ;) )
null
Anyways you can also see that you have a phone on the bottom left of your screen. You can use it to contact girls you meet!
null
there are many apps on there. It's also how you navigate to the different scenes.
null
Anyways, I'll let you go soon, in this demo there is only 1 girl so how about you go find her :)
null
Happy Hunting!
