//Tutorial

Hey there, welcome to [Project Quimbly] (The name isn't in place yet) 
As you may be wondering. What's even going on right now?
well lucky for you I have created this short tutorial.
See on the right over there? That little thing that says 20/20 with a lightning bolt icon?
that right there is your energy, talking to girls and working reduces it.
on the other hand you have money!
Money makes the world go round honey!
You can use that to buy gifts and pay rent for your luxorious apartment!
Later on in the game you can use the grocery store to buy groceries to learn food recipies (For all you feeders out there ;) )
Anyways you can also see that you have a phone on the bottom left of your screen. You can use it to contact girls you meet!
there are many apps on there. It's also how you navigate to the different scenes.
Anyways, I'll let you go soon, in this demo there is only 1 girl so how about you go find her :)
Happy Hunting!
